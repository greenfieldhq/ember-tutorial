<h2>Why</h2>
<p class="flow-text">
  In the transition from 1.0 to 2.0, Ember has had many significant changes. For
  those of us working with Ember regulary, these improvements are great. For
  those trying to learn Ember, however, there have been many challenges. Many
  features have been deprecated, many have been added, and significant syntax
  changes have resulted in much of the existing material becoming out of date.
  Additionally, Ember CLI has become the de facto way to build most Ember apps.
</p>


<h2>What</h2>
<p class="flow-text">
  We'll be building an Ember app using <a href="http://www.ember-cli.com/">Ember CLI</a>.
   We'll be using the <code>rails-api</code> gem to create an API that's
   compliant with <a href="http://jsonapi.org/">JSON API</a>.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p class="flow-text">
  Rails: We'll be using Rails::API for our API so some basic
  knowledge of Rails would be helpful, though you can use whatever you like
  to build the API.
</p>
<p class="flow-text">Javascript: You don't need to be a JS expert, but a
  working knowledge of Javascript is necessary. Additionaly, we'll be use a
  subset of <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/">ES6</a> syntax.
