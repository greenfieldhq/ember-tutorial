  <h2>What we'll build</h2>
  <p class="flow-text">
    As much as I'd like to make a blog or to-do list, let's make an app that
    lets us build stock portfolios. We'll be able to add/edit/delete these
    portfolios and add/edit/delete stocks that belong to these portfolios.
  </p>

  <p class="flow-text">
    The first thing we'll do is set up our project directory. We'll have a
    single project folder with our Rails and Ember app inside. We'll keep both
    apps under one <code>git</code> repo*. In your terminal
    <code>
      <blockquote>
      <p>mkdir portfolio-app</p>
      <p>cd portfolio-app</p>
      <p>git init</p>
    </blockquote>
  </code>
  </p>

  <p>
    * A strong case can be made for keeping your API and Ember App under
    seperate version control so they can evolve seperately, but for simplicity's
    sake we'll use one <code>git</code> repo.
  </p>
