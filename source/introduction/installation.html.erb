<h4 class="center-align">What You'll Need</h4>

<h5>Ruby</h5>
<p class="flow-text">
  Make sure you have Ruby installed, then <code>gem install rails-api</code>.
</p>

<h5>Rails</h5>
<p class="flow-text">
  Why Rails::API instead of Rails? From the
  <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api#readme">README:</a>

  <blockquote cite="https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api">
    Rails::API is a subset of a normal Rails application, created for
    applications that don't require all functionality that a complete Rails
    application provides. It is a bit more lightweight, and consequently a bit
    faster than a normal Rails application.
  </blockquote>
</p>

<h5>Node.JS</h5>
<p class="flow-text">
  You'll want to install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> if you
  don't already have it. I like using <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">NVM</a>
  to manage different versions of Node.js. Use <code>brew install nvm</code>
  (or your preferred method) to install NVM and then
  <code>nvm install v0.12.0</code> to install node.
</p>
<p class="flow-text">
  Confirm you have node installed by running <code>node --version</code>
</p>

<h5>Ember CLI</h5>
<p class="flow-text">
  Got to <a href="http://www.ember-cli.com/#getting-started">Ember CLI</a>
  and follow the getting started for installing CLI, Watchman, and PhantomJS
</p>
<p class="flow-text">
  The <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector">Ember Inspector</a>
  is browser plugin that makes development and debugging easier. Install it
  for each browser you intend to develop with.
</p>

<p>
  * I work on OSX, so I'll be using <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> to install certain packages.
